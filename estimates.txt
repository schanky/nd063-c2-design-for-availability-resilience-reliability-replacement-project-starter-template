1. RTO for single AZ outage

According to AWS documentation, the failover time after an outage is 60-120 seconds.

Assuming above failover time starts as soon as AZ becomes unavailable, estimated min RTO is 120sec and should be automatically detected & managed by RDS.

2. RTO for single regional outage

Remediation Methodology:
- Launch EC2 instance in failover region. Adjust VPC settings in failover region, as well as security group -> 5min
- SSH to the failover instance and connect to the read replica database -> 2min
- Ensure DB is functioning as expected -> ~10min
- Deploy application to EC2 Instance -> 10min
- Verify DB connection -> 5min
- Checks to ensure application is working correctly -> 5min
- Route traffic to application -> 5min
- Bring application out of maintenance mode and route traffic to web server ->2min
- Calculate buffer for unforeseen circumstances -> 5min

Estimated min RTO for single region outage: ~45min

3. RPO for single AZ outage
 
If we assume that the statement in AWS documentation is correct 
and requests continue being server for up to 120s after DB becomes unresponsive,
the estimated RPO for a single AZ outage is 120s

4. RPO for regional outage

- Automatic failover to regional backup ->3min
- Promotion of read replica ->5min
- Switching over traffic to promoted replica ->1min

Estimated RPO for single region outage: ~10min
